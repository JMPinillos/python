00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
So, here's something very interesting about perceptrons,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,540
and it's that some logical operators can be represented as perceptrons.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,659
Here for example, we have the AND operator,

4
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:11,040
and how does that work?

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,570
The AND operator takes two inputs and it returns an output.

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,670
The inputs can be true or false,

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,030
but the output is only true if both of the inputs are true.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,900
So for instance, if the inputs are true and true,

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,834
then the output is true.

10
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,265
If the inputs are true and false,

11
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,080
then the output is false.

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,274
If the inputs are false and true,

13
00:00:34,274 --> 00:00:36,225
then the output is false.

14
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:39,335
Finally, if the inputs are false and false,

15
00:00:39,335 --> 00:00:41,469
then the output is false.

16
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:44,109
Now how do we turn this into a perceptron?

17
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:46,729
Well the first step is to turn this table of true,

18
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,219
false into a table of zeros and ones,

19
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:54,009
where the one corresponds to true and zero corresponds to false.

20
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:57,844
Now we draw this perceptron over here which works just as before.

21
00:00:57,844 --> 00:01:01,280
It has a line defined by weights and bias and it has a positive area

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,135
which is colored blue and a negative area which is colored red.

23
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:08,210
What this perceptron is going to do is it'll plot each point.

24
00:01:08,209 --> 00:01:09,979
If the point falls in the positive area,

25
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,314
then it returns a one,

26
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:12,829
and if it falls in the negative area,

27
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:14,510
then it returns a zero.

28
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,910
So let's try it. The one,

29
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,604
one gets plotted in the positive area.

30
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,390
So the perceptron returns a one.

31
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,280
The one zero gets plotted in the negative area.

32
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,710
So, the perceptron returns a zero.

33
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:30,714
The zero, one gets blurred in the negative area.

34
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,140
So the perceptron returns a zero.

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,159
Finally, the zero, zero also gets plotted in the negative area.

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,854
So the perceptron returns a zero.

37
00:01:40,855 --> 00:01:44,465
Other logical operators can also be turned into perceptrons.

38
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:50,120
For example, here is the OR operator which returns true if any of its two inputs is true.

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,204
That gets turned into this table,

40
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,004
which gets turned into this perceptron,

41
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:56,034
which is very similar as the one before.

42
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:59,450
Except the line has different weights on a different bias.

43
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,049
What are the weights and bias for the AND and the OR preceptor?

44
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:06,119
You'll have the chance to play with them in the quiz below.
