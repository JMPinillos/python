00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,815
Before we get too far on this journey,

2
00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:07,160
let's talk about setting up your computer to complete this Nanodegree program.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,535
In this lesson, we'll walk you through installing Anaconda with Python three,

4
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:13,859
which will use throughout the classroom.

5
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,894
Additionally, we have some notes on installing different text editors.

6
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,009
I personally use Atom.

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,905
However, you can use any text editor you think is best for you.

8
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:28,490
Matt and I will be teaming up to show you the different workflows we recommend,

9
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,945
as they're most common in industry.

10
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:33,975
If you already have your machine setup the way you like,

11
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,375
feel free to skip this whole lesson.

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,310
If you're setting up your computer for

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,980
the first time and get stuck on any part of this lesson,

14
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,719
reach out for help on Slack,

15
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,484
and we'll help you get through.

16
00:00:45,484 --> 00:00:50,429
Don't worry, you'll be able to work through the program as you continue to get setup.

17
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:53,460
There are workspaces available in the classroom to get through

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,575
the program if you don't want to do the work locally.

19
00:00:56,575 --> 00:01:00,880
However, we strongly recommend getting the setup on your local computer,

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,890
as it will prepare you for working in industry.
