Hi. I'm Juno.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,520
I'm Josh.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,720
We're here to share some tips on how to help you succeed in this nano degree program.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,385
So, Josh, you've seen a lot of students go do this program. What's your advice?

5
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:16,440
Yes. So, I think one of the biggest things is to be successful in the program.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,870
You have to be a really active learner.

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,890
What that means is not just watching all of the videos,

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,000
but also a lot of our most successful students take notes,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,130
and they take really good notes.

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,650
So, whether that's screenshots of the videos and then written

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,790
notes underneath on type out notes or for me,

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,890
I actually like just writing things in

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,515
a notepad that I carry around with me and then I can look at later.

14
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:44,615
Also, just when there's coding,

15
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:46,170
writing the code yourself.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,920
So, I think one of the biggest things is you have to write code to learn how to code,

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,710
and sometimes that's just a lot of repetition.

18
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,975
Beyond that, there's a lot of things to do with

19
00:00:56,975 --> 00:01:00,550
time management and how do you manage your time to be a successful student?

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,600
Sure. Managing time is definitely

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,045
a very tricky component that has a big contribution to success.

22
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,220
But what we've seen,

23
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,410
is that students who are most successful,

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,055
come to a classroom at least two times a week.

25
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:16,870
So, just making sure you make that habit of going to the classroom regularly,

26
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,200
you can make a huge difference.

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,515
There's lots of ways to do that.

28
00:01:19,515 --> 00:01:21,330
Yeah. Whether that's due like mobile apps or

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,519
just like blocking out times in your calendar,

30
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,855
and just keeping that on your daily routine.

31
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:30,430
But everything is dependent on your background,

32
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,090
what your learning style is,

33
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,125
and which parts of the course might be newer to you or easier for you.

34
00:01:36,125 --> 00:01:37,380
So, in the end,

35
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,010
just getting to know what your pace is and setting expectations for

36
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,220
yourself and being open to adjusting your time estimations,

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,355
can really help you succeed in the program.

38
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:49,370
So, sometimes, maybe a particular quiz in a lesson

39
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,070
might take you a lot longer than other parts of the lesson.

40
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,250
Sometimes, this can be really good because it can help reinforce

41
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,140
your understanding and really develop your knowledge in that specific topic.

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,735
But sometimes, it could take way longer than you want to and it can be frustrating.

43
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:05,590
Do you have any advice on how to deal with these situations?

44
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,640
Yeah. So, I'll call those blockers,

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,305
and I think we all get them.

46
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:13,115
I think there's two big ways to address blockers.

47
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:14,765
One is to use the community.

48
00:02:14,765 --> 00:02:19,020
There are students who just went through the content that you're going through,

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,320
who just had to learn this for the first time too.

50
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,735
A lot of times, they can give really good advice for things outside of the classroom or

51
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:28,520
specific videos within the classroom or

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,650
specific texts components within the classroom

53
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,420
that helped them really internalize an idea.

54
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,985
Then, the second thing is just being able to Google well.

55
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:39,770
Googling is a skill in of itself.

56
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,895
I think that whether it's being able to take like

57
00:02:43,895 --> 00:02:48,395
an error from your code and search it or read through the documentation,

58
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:52,865
or whether you're trying to really grasp a large project,

59
00:02:52,865 --> 00:02:57,140
and you're looking through it entire blog posts or Quora post,

60
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,320
all of those things can help you better internalize the content

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,700
and even solved just small snips that might be happening in your code.

62
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,950
So, with that, do you have

63
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,250
any final thoughts for students before they tackle their Nanodegree program?

64
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,920
Yeah. So, we hope these tips can help you.

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,425
But in the end, learning is really a mindset,

66
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:17,060
and everyone's going to struggle.

67
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,775
You have to go into this knowing that it's going to be challenging,

68
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,830
and just making sure a patient with yourself

69
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,770
and determined to make sure this is the best learning experience for you,

70
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,235
can really help you succeed.

71
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:28,515
Yeah. So, thank you.

72
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:32,480
We hope that our tips can help you be successful with your Nanodegree program.
