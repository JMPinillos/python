00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:06,450
To implement independent component analysis in scikit-learn, we import FastICA.

2

00:00:06,450  -->  00:00:09,390
Our datasets can be a list,

3

00:00:09,390  -->  00:00:11,850
an array, containing other arrays.

4

00:00:11,850  -->  00:00:14,565
Here's signal 1, signal 2, signal 3.

5

00:00:14,565  -->  00:00:20,820
They can be WAV files and we zip them into one dataset.

6

00:00:20,820  -->  00:00:23,980
Then we declare FastICA and we give it the number

7

00:00:23,980  -->  00:00:27,180
of the original components that we want to retrieve.

8

00:00:27,180  -->  00:00:31,220
Then we tell it to fit, and then components would contain

9

00:00:31,220  -->  00:00:36,120
the independent components that the algorithm was able to find.
