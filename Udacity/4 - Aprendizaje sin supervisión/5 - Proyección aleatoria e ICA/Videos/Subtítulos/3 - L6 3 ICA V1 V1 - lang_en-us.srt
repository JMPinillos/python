1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,985
Independent component analysis is

2

00:00:02,985  -->  00:00:06,930
a method similar to PCA and random projection and that it

3

00:00:06,930  -->  00:00:11,450
takes a set of features and produces a different set that is useful in some way.

4

00:00:11,450  -->  00:00:15,990
But it's different in that PCA works to maximize variance,

5

00:00:15,990  -->  00:00:20,490
ICA assumes that the features are mixtures of independent sources and it

6

00:00:20,490  -->  00:00:25,290
tries to isolate these independent sources that are mixed in this dataset.

7

00:00:25,290  -->  00:00:29,565
The classic example used to explain ICA is something called the cocktail party problem.

8

00:00:29,565  -->  00:00:32,140
Let's look at a variation of this problem.

9

00:00:32,140  -->  00:00:37,765
So, let's say that three of your friends go to an art show and there are three curtains.

10

00:00:37,765  -->  00:00:42,680
One of them opens up and there's a person playing a piano there.

11

00:00:42,680  -->  00:00:45,205
They play a nice tune on the piano,

12

00:00:45,205  -->  00:00:48,920
you're in there to listen to it so you assume that it sounded good.

13

00:00:48,920  -->  00:00:51,350
Then after a little bit of time

14

00:00:51,350  -->  00:00:55,185
another curtain is uncovered and there is a person playing the cello.

15

00:00:55,185  -->  00:00:57,880
The piano is still playing and then cello starts

16

00:00:57,880  -->  00:01:00,175
playing but they're playing two different pieces.

17

00:01:00,175  -->  00:01:02,270
They don't really work together.

18

00:01:02,270  -->  00:01:05,310
There's sort of mixing together, and then,

19

00:01:05,310  -->  00:01:09,320
the third curtain is opened and then there's a TV turned

20

00:01:09,320  -->  00:01:14,315
on and there's this sign wave noise coming in.

21

00:01:14,315  -->  00:01:16,150
It's a little bit of a mess.

22

00:01:16,150  -->  00:01:18,810
So, here your friends decide that "Okay.

23

00:01:18,810  -->  00:01:23,030
This is kind of interesting. Let's take our phones out and record this."

24

00:01:23,030  -->  00:01:26,995
So, they record let's say six seconds of audio for this.

25

00:01:26,995  -->  00:01:32,265
This friend was closer to the piano so they have more piano and they're recording,

26

00:01:32,265  -->  00:01:35,125
this person was closer to the TV so they had more TV.

27

00:01:35,125  -->  00:01:38,630
You have these three recordings and then each of them has

28

00:01:38,630  -->  00:01:42,200
a different level of the original source which you don't have.

29

00:01:42,200  -->  00:01:43,585
You don't have these recordings.

30

00:01:43,585  -->  00:01:47,040
[piano and cello with faint TV noise] The first one sounds like this,

31

00:01:49,900  -->  00:01:57,530
where the TV noise is a little faint and you can hear the piano and then the cello.

32

00:01:57,530  -->  00:02:06,105
The second one there's a little bit more cello, [same music but cello and TV noise are louder]

33

00:02:06,105  -->  00:02:12,240
and the TV got louder and the third one we can even see it here that the TV is little. [same music but TV noise is minimal]

34

00:02:16,850  -->  00:02:20,880
So, if you have only these three recordings,

35

00:02:20,880  -->  00:02:24,060
is there a way for you to retrieve the original signals?,

36

00:02:24,060  -->  00:02:26,675
Datasets? The answer is yes.

37

00:02:26,675  -->  00:02:31,385
That's what an example of what independent component analysis allows you to do.

38

00:02:31,385  -->  00:02:35,270
ICA takes these three samples

39

00:02:35,270  -->  00:02:38,450
or this dataset of sort of three dimensions and we tell it "All right,

40

00:02:38,450  -->  00:02:41,295
there are three original components that were in there.

41

00:02:41,295  -->  00:02:43,475
Can you find them in here?"

42

00:02:43,475  -->  00:02:51,510
It would output piano.

43

00:02:51,510  -->  00:02:53,455
When it's able to work,

44

00:02:53,455  -->  00:02:56,315
it is able to isolate them and then the second output would

45

00:02:56,315  -->  00:03:06,090
be the cello and then the TV.

46

00:03:10,520  -->  00:03:14,795
So, this is a type of problem called the blind

47

00:03:14,795  -->  00:03:19,850
source separation and that's the problem that ICA solves.
