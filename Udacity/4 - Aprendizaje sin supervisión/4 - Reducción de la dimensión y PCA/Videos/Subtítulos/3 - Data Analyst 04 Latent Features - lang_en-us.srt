00:00:00,640  -->  00:00:04,760
To introduce PCA, let's consider an example.

2

00:00:04,760  -->  00:00:08,420
Here, we have a number of factors that are related to homes,

3

00:00:08,420  -->  00:00:12,580
but actually there are two broad categories that these factors fall into.

4

00:00:12,580  -->  00:00:14,040
The size of the house,

5

00:00:14,040  -->  00:00:16,040
and the neighborhood that the house is in.

6

00:00:16,040  -->  00:00:19,640
These two factors are known as latent features.

7

00:00:19,640  -->  00:00:22,840
They are features that aren't directly in our dataset,

8

00:00:22,840  -->  00:00:26,780
but encompass groupings of the features we have in our dataset.

9

00:00:26,780  -->  00:00:30,800
Surveys often have questions that are related to latent features.

10

00:00:30,800  -->  00:00:33,180
Take a look at these survey questions.

11

00:00:33,180  -->  00:00:37,880
Can you identify which latent features are related to these questions?
